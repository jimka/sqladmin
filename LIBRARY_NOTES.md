# Library notes (`@jimka/typescript-ui`)

SQLAdmin is a demo app that doubles as a real-world test of the widget library.
This file logs every **bug** and **usage papercut** hit while building it, so the
library can be made more straightforward later. Newest entries first.

## 🐞✅ Component `#id` CSS rule not escaped → breaks on ids with `.`/`:`

**Symptom:** A `Dock` panel rendered with its tab bar *behind* the content — the
content frame overlapped and hid the `TabBar`.

**Root cause (library):** Each component's `position:absolute` (and all other
rule-based styles) comes from a per-component CSS rule scoped to `#<id>`. The
selector was built as `"#" + id` with **no `CSS.escape`** (`core/StyleTarget.ts`
`_selectorOf`). Our Dock panel id was `public.customers`; `#public.customers`
parses in CSS as *id `public` + class `customers`*, so the rule never matched
the element, `position:absolute` was dropped, and the frame collapsed to
`position:static` (rendering at top:0 over the tab bar).

**Fix (library):** `_selectorOf` now `CSS.escape`es the id; added an optional
`suffix` to the `component` scope so live selector suffixes (`:hover`,
`.selected`) stay unescaped. Hardened `DOM` `escapeSelector` to fall back when
`CSS.escape` is absent (jsdom/SSR). Regression test: `tests/core/StyleTarget.test.ts`.

**Takeaway:** Any consumer-supplied id (Dock panel ids, component ids) could
contain CSS-special chars. The library should escape ids everywhere it builds a
selector from one — audit other `#${id}` / `'#' + id` sites for the same gap.

## ✂️ Remote `AjaxStore` silently needs a page size to parse an envelope

A remote store whose backend returns a `{rows, totalCount}` envelope only parses
it in **paginated** mode — i.e. only when the read carries `page`/`pageSize`.
With no page size set, `AjaxProxy.read` runs the unpaginated branch, which
expects a **top-level array**, and throws `response is not an array`.

**App workaround:** always set `pageSize` on the store (`data/stores.ts`).

**Suggestion:** make the envelope/array decision driven by the reader/response
shape rather than by whether pagination params were sent, or surface a clearer
error ("expected an array but got an object — did you mean to set a page size /
configure a rootProperty?").

---

## ✂️ `AjaxStore` store-level options only apply via the single-bag form

`remoteSort` / `remoteFilter` / `pageSize` are only honored when the store is
built with the single options bag (`new AjaxStore({ model, proxy, ... })`). The
positional `new AjaxStore(model, proxyOptions)` form skips `applyOptions`, so
those options are silently ignored.

**Suggestion:** either apply store options in the positional path too, or
document/deprecate the positional form.

---

## ✂️ Construction idiom is discoverable only by reading the demos

The preferred "callable shorthand + options bag" style (`Panel({ layoutManager:
HBox(), components: [...] })`, `Table(store)`) — and the fact that components/
layouts are `callable()`-wrapped (work with or without `new`) while data classes
(`Model`, `AjaxStore`, `JsonReader`) are **not** — isn't documented; it was
learned from `ComplexUIPanel.ts`.

**Suggestion:** a short "constructing components" doc page covering the callable
shorthand, `components:`/`layoutManager:` nesting, and which exports are callable.

## ✂️ Glyph barrel import pulls ~2,000 modules in dev

Importing from `@jimka/typescript-ui/glyphs/solid` (the barrel) makes Vite's dev
server fetch every glyph module on page load. Per-glyph subpath imports
(`.../glyphs/solid/file`) + `Glyph.register(...)` are required. (Documented in
`MenuBarPanel.ts`; flagging here as a real consumer papercut.)

## ✂️ Linking the library into a Vite app needs config tweaks

Consuming the library via a symlinked local dep (`file:../../typescript-ui`)
needed `server.fs.strict: false`, `resolve.dedupe`, and
`optimizeDeps.exclude` for `@jimka/typescript-ui` (see `frontend/vite.config.ts`)
to avoid out-of-root fs errors and double-bundling. Worth a documented recipe
for local development against the library.
